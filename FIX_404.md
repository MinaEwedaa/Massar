# Quick Fix for 404 Error

## The Problem
The Railway integration in Railway settings doesn't automatically configure Vercel. You need to manually set the environment variable in Vercel.

## Solution (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Get Your Railway Backend URL
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Copy the **Public Domain** URL (e.g., `https://your-app.up.railway.app`)
4. Your API base URL should be: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/v1`

### Step 2: Set Environment Variable in Vercel
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click on your project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Click **Add New**
5. Enter:
   - **Key**: `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/api/v1` (use your actual Railway URL)
   - **Environment**: Check all three (Production, Preview, Development)
6. Click **Save**
7. **IMPORTANT**: Go to **Deployments** tab → Click the three dots (⋯) on the latest deployment → **Redeploy**

### Step 3: Set CORS in Railway
1. Go to Railway dashboard → Your service → **Variables** tab
2. Add or update:
   - **Name**: `CORS_ORIGINS`
   - **Value**: Your Vercel URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)
3. Railway will automatically redeploy

### Step 4: Test
1. Wait for both deployments to complete
2. Visit your Vercel site
3. Open browser console (F12) and check for errors
4. Try using the app - it should work now!

## Still Not Working?

Check the browser console (F12) and look for:
- **404 errors**: The API URL might be wrong - check Step 2
- **CORS errors**: The CORS_ORIGINS might be wrong - check Step 3
- **Network errors**: Railway service might be down - check Railway dashboard

## Quick Debug

In your browser console on the Vercel site, run:
```javascript
console.log('API URL:', import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL);
```

This shows what URL your frontend is using. It should match your Railway URL.
